# Mars Data Scraping
In this project, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

Once the web application is started and the scrape button is pushed, the application scrapes the following websites and searches for the following information:

- NASA Mars News
  - Latest news title
  
  - Latest paragraph text
  
    ![latestnews](C:\Users\simon_qba\mars-scraping\Screenshots\latestnews.PNG)
- JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Images
  - Current featured Mars image
  
    ![featuredimage](C:\Users\simon_qba\mars-scraping\Screenshots\featuredimage.PNG)
- Mars Facts
  - Table containing: Equatorial Diameter, Polar Diameter, Mass, Moons, Orbit Distance, Orbit Period, Surface Temperature, First Record, Recorded By
  
    <img src="C:\Users\simon_qba\mars-scraping\Screenshots\facts.PNG" alt="facts" style="zoom:50%;" />
- Mars Hemispheres
  - Title and full resolution image URL for each of the hemispheres

After this data is scraped, it is then loaded to a HTML file and displayed there.
