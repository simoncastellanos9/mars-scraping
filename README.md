# Mars Data Scraping
In this project, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

Once the web application is started and the scrape button is pushed, the application scrapes the following websites and searches for the following information:

- NASA Mars News
  - Latest news title
  - Latest paragraph text
- JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Images
  - Current featured Mars image
- Mars Facts
  - Table containing: Equatorial Diameter, Polar Diameter, Mass, Moons, Orbit Distance, Orbit Period, Surface Temperature, First Record, Recorded By
- Mars Hemispheres
  - Title and full resolution image URL for each of the hemispheres

After this data is scraped, it is then loaded to a HTML file and displayed there.
